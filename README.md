# Mayor

Mayor is a project created during my ASP.NET module in SoftUni (Software University). It's sole purpose is to 
help citizens all over the world build the community they want to live in. The platform is supply-demand based
and there are 2 user types - Citizen (issue-creator) and Institution (issue-solver). User experience is strictly
based on which type they choose.
